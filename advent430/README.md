# Advent430

This directory holds a fork of [Open
Adventure](https://gitlab.com/esr/open-adventure), ported for Wasm2Glulx. It was
created as a proof-of-concept for the tool. It runs in what Open Adventure calls
"oldstyle" mode, meaning that the player experience should be unchanged from
the orginial 1995 release of Adevnture 2.5.
