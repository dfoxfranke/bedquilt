//! Sound.
//!
//! This module provides access to audio-playback features on Glk
//! implementations that support it. Any sounds that you wish to play must be
//! include as `Snd` resources in your game's Blorb file. You can open a sound
//! channel using [`SoundChannel::new`] and then use its `play` methods to play
//! sounds identified by their resource index, optionally obtaining a future
//! which will become ready when playback finishes.

/// two. But playing two .ogg files in parallel requires two channels.
