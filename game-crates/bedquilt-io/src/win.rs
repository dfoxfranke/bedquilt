//! Window management and user interaction.
//! 
//! Bedquilt deals in four types of windows:
//! 
//! 1. **Text buffer** windows display running text, possibly with support for
//!    styling, hyperlinks, and images. The usual "main window" of a text adventure
//!    is a text buffer window.
//! 
//! 2. **Text grid** windows display monospaced text and support repositioning
//!    the cursor. These are typically used for displaying status bars.
//! 
//! 3. **Graphics** windows provide a canvas for displaying images and drawing
//!    rectangles.
//! 
//! 4. **Blank** windows areâ€¦ blank.
//! 
//! In Glk, there is a fifth window type, a **pair** window. A pair window
//! divides up the screen space allocated to it to display exactly two child
//! windows, which might themselves be pair windows, by splitting the space
//! horizontally or vertically. The set of all windows thereby forms a binary
//! tree, with all interior nodes being pair windows and all leaf nodes being
//! one of the four type above.
//! 
//! When you close one of a pair window's two children, this automatically
//! destroys the pair window as well, with the surviving child's grandparent
//! becoming its parent. This behavior doesn't play well with Rust's borrow
//! rules. Bedquilt deals with this by never directly providing a handle to a
//! pair window. In Bedquilt, when you want to operate on a pair window, you
//! invoke a method on one of the pair window's descendants and supply a
//! non-zero `nth_ancestor` argument to indicate which of the leaf window's
//! ancestors you want to operate on.
//! 
//! To get started with this module, use the [`Window::create_as_root`] method
//! to create your first window, and then use that window's `split_`* methods to
//! create additional ones. You can print text to a [`TextBufferWindow`] or
//! [`TextGridWindow`] by using its [`core::fmt::Write`] implementation. `Write`
//! is implemented not only on the window structures but also on shared
//! references to them, so you can write to them given only a shared reference
//! when `Write`'s methods would otherwise require a `&mut Self`. 
//! 
//! Once have a window, you can use the [`CharInput`], [`LineInput`],
//! [`MouseInput`], and [`HyperlinkInput`] traits to request user input from
//! them. All of these traits return futures which become ready when the input
//! is available. Bedquilt *does* allow multiple futures of the same type to be
//! pending at the same time for the same window, in which case they will become
//! ready one at a time, each with a different instance of user input. However,
//! it is unspecified what order they will become ready in; the first one
//! created is not necessarily the first to become ready. In some future
//! release, this specification may be refined to provide more useful
//! guarantees.
//! 
//! Currently, only one window at a time is allowed to have line input pending;
//! further requests will return
//! [`GlkAreaAllocError`](crate::error::Error::GlkAreaAllocError). This limit
//! will increase in a future release.
