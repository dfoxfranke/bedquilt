# glulx-asm

`glulx-asm` is a Glulx assembler used by and co-developed with Wasm2Glulx.
Currently, it is the only the backend of an assembler: it can produce Glulx
story files or human-readable output from an AST, but it has no parser for
creating an AST from human-readable text. It may grow such functionality in the
future.

`glulx-asm` is not documented here, but at <https://docs.rs/glulx-asm>.
